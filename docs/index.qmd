## Project Abstract
The goal is to create a functional, visually engaging slot machine simulation that:

- Accepts a penny slot and “spin” button input.

- Displays animated reels on a VGA output.

- Sequentially stops each reel to show a final symbol combination determined randomly by the MCU.

- Calculates and displays winnings and total credits based on the result.

- Uses a coin detector to allow the user to add credits, as well as an adjustable rotary switch to set the wager amounts

The FPGA will handle the video display including sending information to the VGA and time-sensitive animations, while the MCU will manage the game logic/state, input handling, and random number generation.

The system will include:
- Three spinning reels rendered on a VGA monitor.

- A coin slot, push buttons, and a switch for user interaction:

- Spin Button — initiates reel animation.

- Denomination Switch - indicated how much to bet per spin

- Coin Slot — triggers an interrupt and increments credits using a phototransistor

- 5 seven segment displays, 2 for credits won on the previous spin, and 3 for total credits accrued

The design will interface the MCU and FPGA via SPI communication, allowing the FPGA to render and display the visual state based on the game logic computed by the MCU. Our project meets all the specifications we set.
